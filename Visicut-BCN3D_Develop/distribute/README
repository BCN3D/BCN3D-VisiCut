This folder is for automated creation of a distributable ZIP file.

If you run the distribute.sh script, it will run ant to clean and compile the whole visicut project, then it will copy the output files plus any files in the "distribute/files" folder into a temporary folder, which
will be added to the new created VisiCut.zip file.
The "files" folder contains startup scripts for ceveral OSes and a default set of settings and predefined Materials.
